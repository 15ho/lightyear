  - use local executors for async, and use one process/thread per core instead of doing multi-threading (more complicated and less performant
  - one server: 1 game room per core?

PROBLEMS/BUGS:
- None right now

ROUGH EDGES:
- users cannot derive traits on ComponentProtocol or MessageProtocol because we add some extra variants to those enums
- the bitcode/Bytes parts are confusing and make extra copies
- users cannot specify how they serialize messages/components

- SYNC:
  - sync only works if we send client updates every frame. Otherwise we need to take a LOT more margin on the server
    to make sure that client packets arrive on time. -> MAKE SYNC COMPATIBLE WITH CLIENT UPDATE_INTERVAL (ADD UPDATE_INTERVAL TO MARGIN?)
  - Something probably BREAKS BECAUSE OF THE WRAPPING OF TICK AND WRAPPED-TIME, THINK ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
    - weird wrapping logic in sync manager is probably not correct
  - can have smarter speedup/down for the sync system

- MapEntities:
  - if we receive a mapped entity but the entity doesn't exist, we just don't do any mapping; but then the entity could be completely wrong?
    - in that case should we just wait for the entity to be created or present in the mapping (this is what naia does)? And if it doesn't get created we just ignore the message?
    - the entity mapping is present in the entity_map which exists on client, but not on server. So we cannot do the mapping on server.



TODO:

- Serialization:
  - have a NetworkMessage macro that all network messages must derive (Input, Message, Component)
    - DONE: all network messages derive Message
  - all types must be Encode/Decode always. If a type is Serialize/Deserialize, then we can convert it to Encode/Decode ?

- Prediction:
  - TODO: handle despawns, spawns
      - despawn another entity TODO:
        - we let the user decide 
          - in some cases it's ok to let the created entity despawn
          - in other cases we would like to only despawn that entity if confirm despawns it (for example a common object)
            -> the user should write their systems so that despawns only happen on the confirmed timeline then
    - spawn: TODO
      i.e. we spawn something that depends on the predicted action (like a particle), but actually we rollback,
      which means that we need to kill the spawned entity. 
      - either we kill immediately if it doesn't get spawned during rollback
      - either we let it die naturally; either we fade it out?
      -> same, the user should write their systems so that spawns only happen on the confirmed timeline
      
  - TODO: 2 ways to create predicted entities
    - DONE: server-owned: server creates the confirmed entity, when client receives it, it creates a copy which is a predicted entity -> we have this one
    - TODO: client-owned: client creates the predicted entity. It sends a message to client, which creates the confirmed entity however it wants
      then when client receives the confirmed entity, it just updates the predicted entity to have a full mapping -> WE DONT HAVE THIS ONE YET
     
- Replication:
  - Fix the enable_replication flag, have a better way to enable/disable replication
  - POSSIBLE TODO: send back messages about entity-actions having been received? (we get this for free with reliable channels, but we need to notify the replication manager)

- Message Manager
  - TODO: run more extensive soak test. Soak test with multiple clients, replication, connections/disconnections and different send_intervals?

- Packet Manager:
  - TODO: construct the final Packet from Bytes without using WriteBuffer and ReadBuffer, just concat Bytes to avoid having too many copies

- Channels:
  - TODO: add channel priority with accumulation. Some channels need infinite priority though (such as pings)

- UI:
  - TODO: UI that lets us see which packets are sent at every system update?

- Metrics/Logs:
  - add more metrics
  - think more about log levels. Can we enable sub-level logs via filters? for example enable all prediction logs, etc.

- Reflection: 
  - when can we use this?
